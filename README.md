#Tesla Stock Price Time Series Forecasting
Problem Statement:
This project aims to analyze and forecast stock price trends using time series forecasting techniques. By working with real Tesla stock data from Kaggle, by perform trend analysis, seasonality identification, and build models such as ARIMA and SARIMA to predict future prices. The objective is to gain practical exposure to time series modeling and understand the statistical patterns underlying financial time series.
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting Tesla's historical stock closing prices using time series analysis techniques. Leveraging Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and statsmodels, it applies methods such as seasonal decomposition, rolling statistics, and ARIMA modeling to understand trends, seasonality, and volatility in TSLA stock prices.
